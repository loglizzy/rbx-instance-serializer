## ‚ö° Performance

Benchmarks on a **model with 34,686 children**:

| Mode                                     | Size (bytes) | Time (seconds) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Single (model instance only, no childs)  | 35           | 0.000027       |
| Recursive (instance + children)          | 4,963,573    | 0.132          |
| RecursiveWithDiffs (recursive + caching) | 4,324,440    | 0.274          |

_Benchmarks run on a low-end **Intel i5 vPRO** laptop CPU._
