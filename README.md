# About
Ultra fast and size effective instance serializer for Roblox.
Can serialize a game entire map under 1 second even on slow CPUs.

# Objectives with that project
1. Make something really good to save condo maps/dick builds and load them into my enemies backdoored games.
2. Distribute free good usefull code, so people dont have to use shit ass instance serializers that use `Instance.new` and `loadstring`.

# Todo
* Add multi threading(would boost perfomance linear to the user CPU cores amount)
* Add copy paste suport(by not using a range of characters at the output; also would increase size but it's acceptable)
