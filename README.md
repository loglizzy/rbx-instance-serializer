# üì¶ Roblox Instance Serializer

**Ultra-fast, size-efficient serializer for Roblox Instances**

Easily serialize and deserialize Roblox Instances with insane speed and minimal size.

It's output is approximately 59%(62% with diffs mode) smaller than the most commum Roblox instance serialization method.

## ‚ú® Usage

Get the latest release at https://github.com/loglizzy/rbx-instance-serializer/releases

local InstanceSerializer = require(path.to["instance-serializer"])

-- Serialize an instance
local serialized = InstanceSerializer.Single(workspace.Part)
print(serializer)

-- Deserialize back to an instance
local restored = InstanceSerializer.DeSingle(serialized)
restored.Parent = workspace
```

## ‚ö° Performance

Benchmarks on a **model with 34,686 children**:

| Mode                                     | Size (bytes) | Size (KB) | Size (MB) | Time (seconds) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Single (selected instance only)          | 35           | 0.035     | 0.000035  | 0.000027       |
| Recursive (instance + children)          | 4,963,573    | 4,963.573 | 4.964     | 0.132          |
| RecursiveWithDiffs (recursive + caching) | 4,324,440    | 4,324.440 | 4.324     | 0.274          |
